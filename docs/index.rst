Welcome to **MOMF** Documentation!
===========================================

Is energy system modeling tools that identify features of a robust
energy policy: a policy that performs well relative to alternatives. The
tools are based on the Open Souce Modeling System (OSeMOSYS), are named
the **M**\ ultipurpose **O**\ Se **M**\ OSYS-based **F**\ ramework (MOMF).


The MOMF can support energy decarbonization planning exercises, and it
is suitable to address the uncertainty involved in a decadeslong
process. It compares possible NDP futures -quantitative combinations of
uncertainties and sectoral policy objectives- to a business-as-usual
(BAU) scenario without decarbonization. The MOMF also evaluates actors
within a country, including the fiscal impacts of decarbonization,
following the best practices of applied energy modeling for policy
support.

Currently, ``MOMF`` exclusively accommodates the GNU MathProg variant of OSeMOSYS.
