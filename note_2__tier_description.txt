Tier1_Scenario_Confection: allows building a model and making scenarios (1 future)
Tier2_Scenario_Transfers: allows quantifying transfers for different actors, as well as other financial metrics (1 future)
Tier3a_Experiments: allows developing experiments with OSeMOSYS and TEM (many futures)
Tier3b_Scenario_Discovery: allows extracting cause-effect insights from the experiments

NOTE: *Tier3a_Experiments* should have N experiments. The user must create a folder named "Experiment_N", with N is the experiment ID.
